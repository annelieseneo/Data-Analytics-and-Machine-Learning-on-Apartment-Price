# Data Analytics and Machine Learning on Apartment Price

Task Highlights : 

- Import the apartment_price.csv

- Explore the data and statistics.

- Use a Correlation Matrix to interpret your correlation coefficients, in terms of the types of correlations, their strengths, and surprising findings. 

- Set “SalePrice” attribute as the label. 

- Split the dataset to 80% training and 20% testing data.

- Create a model using Linear Regression.

- Evaluate the performance of Linear Regression. Select the main criterion as “First”, and include the root mean square error, the absolute error, and the relative error.

- Interpret the Linear Regression Weight, and identify attributes that can be dropped from the data set as ineffective non-predictors.

- Compare the prices in the testing data, actual price against predicted price.
